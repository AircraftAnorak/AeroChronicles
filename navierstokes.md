<h1>Navier-Stokes Equations</h1>

The Navier-Stokes equations are partial differential equations which describe the motion of viscous fluid substances

{: .info }
> The Navier-Stokes equations are named after the French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and the Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes
>
> They were developd over several decades of progressively building the theories

These equations are valid in all regions where the fluid is present and the solution of these is a flow velocity

## Mass Conservation

Of vector ***V*** with components u, v:

$$ \frac{\delta u}{\delta x} + \frac{\delta v}{\delta y} = 0 $$
