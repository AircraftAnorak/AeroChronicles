<h1>Fluid Mechanics</h1>


There are 4 primary forces which act on any object which moves through a fluid:
- Lift
- Thrust
- Drag
- Weight (Gravity)

> On an aircraft, lift balances the force from gravity and is generated mainly by the wing

The shape of the wing is called an aerofoil - these are generally designed to produce lift when moved through a fluid

# Streamlines

Streamlines are trajectories of individual fluid elements and they cannot be crossed by fluid elements

Since the curvature on the top is greater (for this AoA) flow speed must be larger on the top surface and slower below it

- The acceletrated flow on the top surface caused by the curvature of the aerofoil and AoA decreases the pressure here

- In turn, the bottom surface will decelerate which increases the pressure

The net of this difference is the <b>Lift Force</b>

Unlike the leading edge, streamlines at the trailing edge are essentially parallel
